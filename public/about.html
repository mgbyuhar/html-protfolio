<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Bhyu Har Hein. I am 27 years old. I am originally from Myanmar which is known as Burma. After I graduated high school I went to South Korea to go to University. I learned Korean for two years in South Korea.
  I can speak, read, listen and write Korean fluently. I learned Korean in Dongguk University in Seoul. After that, I went to Korea Aerospace University stydying in major of Aeronautical Science. I really wanted to become a pilot since I was young. I mean every boy wants to become a pilot, who doesn't ?
  My second dream is to become a software developer. I got in touch with computer since I was a little boy. My sister bought her first computer and that become mine too(forcefully). I open up my sister PC and look inside of it. I can't tell how amazing it was ? 
  Anyway, I always keep in touch in touch with computers since I was young. I was really hard to get acess to the internet at that time in my country. So, just the computer, just so you know.

<p>While duing my in my University, I went to United State for my first time in 2018 for my flight training. That was also a part of the University program. I did not like the America as much as I think. I don't like the curture , life style , food and many more. Anyway , that was my first time in State. It was about 3 months in Arizona. After I got my Private Pilot Certificate , I went back to South Korea and study my remaining semester. Although I did not like the US, however US is the best place for flight training. So, I dicided to go back to US to get my other pilot certificates. In 2019 , I went back to US but different school and different state, this time in Oregon.
  And then COVID happened in early 2020. I got delayed in my flight training. I got my Certified Flight Instructor license in 2021. I was really hard to get a job back then. So, I decided to work in restaurant industury to cover my expenses and bills. During that time, I had a chance to study more about American life and cultures and many more. Since that time , till now I couldn't find a job in my degree related industury which is Aviation. I bet I cannot work long time is restaurant industury since it is not my passion. Although , aviation industury is very slow right now I decided to head back into IT industury. I want to do master in CS and dont't know what to start. I saw Ms.Angela course in Udemy doing discount on my Facebook. I decided to buy the course and start my first step into IT. My goal is to get into Master in CS, and get job at high paying tech company. Hope to get six fifure in a year, work from home , give some time for myself , my family and to the people that I love. From my income I hope to get some money , get invested into something and get finicial freedom by the age of 40.

<p>Anyway, I have three major goals in my life.</p>
<ol>
  <li>To become a Pilot</li>
  <li>To become a software developer</li>
  <li>To own a bakery</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I got all my pilot licenses, it is not really hard to accomplish my first goal.
  To accomplish the second goal, I just took my big first step into IT.
  I think if I completely accomplished the first two steps , the last one will be a peace of cake.
  Thank you for reading my completely non-sense goals and ideas. Thank you for wasting your time reading about me.
  I hope you don't read this again. LOL.
